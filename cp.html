                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    The United States has a long history marked by instances of injustice against the 
                    black community. American capitalism itself was built upon the brutal foundations 
                    of black slavery. Despite commendable strides, the nation grapples with persistent 
                    challenges that demand a solemn reckoning. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Racial bias 
                    continues to manifest in tragic instances of police brutality against black 
                    individuals. Equally disconcerting is the glaring lack of mainstream media 
                    attention afforded to missing black children and women. Within the judicial realm, 
                    a disheartening reality unfolds, where black victims often find themselves devoid 
                    of the quality and care essential for the pursuit of justice.

                    The United States has a long history of committing atrocities against black people. 
                    American capitalism was built on the slavery of black people. In many ways the US has 
                    come a long way to negate a laundry list of crimes. But to this day, black people are 
                    still murdered by police due to the result of racial bias. Missing black children and 
                    women are less likely to be covered by the mainstream media. There are a plethora of 
                    judicial cases where black victims do not receive the quality and care in pursuit of 
                    justice.

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    Eliminate ignorance about the systemic racism in the United States. Make an impact by 
                    showing the alarming proximity in time of heinous acts committed against the black 
                    community. This was created in hopes to educate, inform and in turn disrupt the cyclical
                    nature of history. Embracing the principle that "Those who forget history are doomed to 
                    repeat it," the intention is to build a future grounded in understanding, empathy, 
                    and positive change.

                <p>The seriousness of the content and subject matter warranted use of stark contrast of black and white. Then an accent color was needed for emphasis that was bright and bold and a reddish orange was chosen to indicate passion, energy and action. The intent is to insinuate the danger that is never that far away and to invoke anger at the brutality against the black community for hundreds of years.</p>
