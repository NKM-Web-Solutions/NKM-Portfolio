                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Ever since I was little, I've been artistically inclined. When I was 5 years old I broke my right arm so naturally I started drawing and coloring with my left hand. These days, I find UX/UI design to be the perfect expression of my creative instincts and design background.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">I love the challenge of problem solving that web development often brings. I can confidently exceed the requirements of web pages and systems as well as build clean, optimized web solutions.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">I got my Bachelor's in Digital Media Web Design from the University of Central Florida in 2016. In my years there I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, I studied server-side programming mostly using PHP as well as basic database operations using MySQL. Then, on the design design I studied graphic design and UX/UI, using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create prototypes for applications and web pages.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Since earning my degree, I've been nurturing my web development career and expanding my skillset with the help of two professional web development positions, the first being at an affiliate marketing company and the current at a mortgage brokerage. I've truly honed in on front end web development in a professional work environment working in small and large web development projects that utilized React, Angular and Vue. I've had the opportunity to expand my backend web development skillset by writing server side code using PHP, Node and ColdFusion. Additionally, I've become skilled at writing optimized database operations in MongoDB, MySQL and SQL.</p>
